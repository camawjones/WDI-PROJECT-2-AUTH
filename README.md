# WDI PROJECT 2 - Gigl

Using Javascript and EJS (Embedded Javascript Templates) I created a fully restful services platform for freelance web designers to upload their portfolios, skills, and for others to review and hire them. With the look and feel of this site I wanted to take a fun tech startup angle since the majority of devs or companies using a site like this would be coming from that area. I used HK Grotesk throughout the site as I felt this font successfully fulfilled my aesthetic aims and designed the logo and homepage background myself using Creative Suite.

####Packages used:

- Mongoose 
- Bluebird
- Express.js
- node.js
- body-parser
- SCSS
- EJS

Using SCSS for styling made the whole process a lot easier to manage and organise especially with a multipage web application.

This was also my first project using backend frameworks, a database and authentication which felt hard at first but by the end of the project I had a good grasp of the core concepts and backend functionality for the website.

####If I had more time:

- I would want to add filtering for the users so that if you were looking for a particular type of developer you could search for them specifically.
- I would make it responsive as it would definitely be an application that users would want to access on their mobile as well as their computer.
